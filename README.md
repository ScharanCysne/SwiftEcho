# ECHO (a.k.a Efficient Chatbot and Helper Orchestrator)

## Introduction

A IOS App written in Swift 5 that brings GenAI and State Machines together. 

This template is open for developers to create their own Copilot Agent, connecting the 
UX enhancements derived from GenAI models with strict business logic defined in State 
Machines. This allows the user to create well-define actions and pipelines to be executed 
by the Agent, all while nurturing the flexibility of GenAI models to respond and interact 
with the user.
